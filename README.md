This repository contains all of my code programs and work which I performed in the above mentioned course.
- Labs Inclass (#8)
- Assignments & Projects (#3)

Course Information
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...

```
  * From gaining a basic/ fundamental knowledge to become quick and efficient in the Data Structures & Algorithms
    with Python Programming.
  * Gain a handsome knowledge on all of the procedural & object-oriented aspects of C++ programming namely-
     - Intro to C++ Programming.
     - Difference between Procedural aspects & Object-Oriented Programming.
     - Difference between C & C++.
     - Advantages of OOP & Applications of OOP based language.
     - Introduction to three pillars of OOP - Polymorphism, Abstraction & Inheritance.
     - A basic structure of a C++ program; objects of the standard input/ output stream - cin, cout & endl
     - Classes & Objects, Access Modifiers of the class - public, protected & private.
     - Revised topic from C such as:
        * Control Logical Constructs(if...else, Nested if-else, Switch statements)
        * Procedural aspect of C++ - Functions.
        * Recursive Functions.
        * Pointers.
     - References & Alias, Dynamic Memory Allocation.  
     - Constructors (Default & Parameterized) & Destructors.
     - Copy Constructors & Assignment Operators.
     - Function Overloading.
     - Friend functions.
     - Operator Overloading (Unary & Binary Overloading), Restrictions, Overloading & Exceptions.
     - Polymorphism - Function Overriding & Overloading.
     - Data Abstraction - Pure Virtual Function.
     - Pure Virtual Functions/ Abstract Class.
     - Generic Templates
     - File Handling (read, write & append).
     - Template Functions & Classes.
     - Exceptional Handling (Try & Catch Block)
     - Debugging Methods & Troubleshooting, Walkthroughs, Modular Aspects of Programming.
     - Syntactic and Semantic Errors
 ```

```
I declare that all the code in this repository is entirely my own work and the group assignments
were meant to be a comprehensive work between me and my teammate.

NOTE: For others, this repo can be a good reference, if someone wants to learn &
understand the aspects of Data Structures with Python programming and it's topic
but must not copy the work completed by me or included in this repo!
